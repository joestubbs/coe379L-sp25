Project 3 Summary 
=================

While the grades were not as quite high as the previous two projects, overall the class still did a great job on 
Project 3!

* 4th place:           0.9509 accuracy -- three groups



Common Issues
-------------

Analysis:

* Incorrect Architectures (e.g., wrong number of convultion/pooling layers in the Alternate Lenet 5 architecture)
* Train/test split -- trying to use the sklearn function (impressive, but keep in mind memory issues)
* Wrong number of images in the directory 

Inference servers: By far, the most issues were with the inference servers. 

* Docker image not pushed to Docker Hub
* Docker images did not build. 
* HTTP inference server got low accuracy

Report:

* Readme not provided with instructions to start inference server.
* Missing report
